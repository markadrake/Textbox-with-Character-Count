# Textbox-with-Character-Count

This is a custom property editor for the [Umbraco CMS](http://umbraco.com/). 

This property editor creates a regular text input field, but includes a maximum character count as well. As you enter characters the counter will decrease, until it reaches 0 and does not allow the content author to continue typing.
