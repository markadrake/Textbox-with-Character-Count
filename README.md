# Umbraco Property Editors

This serves as a collection of custom property editors created for the [Umbraco CMS](http://umbraco.com/). 

## Tags Improved
This property editor is a duplicate of the regular Tags in Umbraco. The improvements include:
1. Clicking the title will allow you to edit a tag. Before any click on the tag, close to the (x) or not, would cause the tag to simply be removed without warning.
2. Hovering close to the (x) will change the color of the button to red as a visual indicator that you are about to remove the tag.

## Textbox Improved and Textarea Improved
These property editors are duplicates of the regular Textbox and Textarea in Umbraco, but allows you to set a maximum character count. As you type text in the field the counter will countdown to 0 and not allow further entry.
